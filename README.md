# About
#### This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on determining the NBA Champion from regular season statistics


# Contributors
#### Matthias - Motivation, Research question, cleaning of dataset, logistic regression and its hyperparamter tuning, oversampling
#### Matthew - filtering of variables, EDA, cleaning of data
#### Cheng Yin - cleaning of data, decision tree and hyperparameter tuning


# Problem Definition
#### Can we use NBA regular season to determine the NBA champion?
#### And if so, what are those determining features?


# Methods to filter out the variables
#### Wrapper method
#### Embedded method


# Models Used
#### Decision tree
#### Logistic Regression


# What did we learn that was new?
#### Oversampling using SMOTE
#### Logistic Regression using sklearn
#### Hyperparameter tuning using grisearch
#### Filtering methods such as embedded and wrapper method


# Conclusions
#### How efficiently a team shoots is integral to be the champion
#### How well rounded you are as a team is integral in your championship run
#### It is possible to determine the NBA champion based on regular season statistics even if they seem unrelated
#### Decision tree tends to perform slightly better than logistic regression
